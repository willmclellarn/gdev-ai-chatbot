# General Dev Codebase Rules

1. **Use `pnpm` as the package manager.**  
   Always run installation and dependency commands with `pnpm` (e.g., `pnpm install` etc.).

2. **Next.js fullstack with App Router.**  
   This codebase is built on Next.js, leveraging the App Router (`app/` directory) for routing and server components.

3. **Use `shadcn` for UI components wherever possible.**  
   Prefer Shadcnâ€™s prebuilt or customized UI elements to maintain a consistent look and feel.

4. **Loading states in UI.**  
   Ensure that every server or data-fetch action includes a visible loading state so users know an operation is in progress.

5. **Display backend responses in the UI.**  
   Expose server or API responses (success/error) in a clear way, aiding both debugging and user feedback.

6. **Use Drizzle for DB operations, underlying, we have supabaseâ€™s local dev server for development, and its PostgreSQL DB in production.**  
   For DB operations, use drizzle.

7. **Use Pinecone for vector databases.**  
   For vector-based tasks, use Pinecone. Maintain references between your main data store (Supabase) and Pinecone for efficient search and retrieval.

8. **Logging guidelines**
   Use my backend emoji ðŸ”µ for backend logs, and ðŸŸ¡ for frontend logs

9. **Email guidelines**
   Use Resend for email api needs

10. **DB Migrations**
   Use the pnpm run db:push in order to generate and run migrations after editing the Drizzle schema
