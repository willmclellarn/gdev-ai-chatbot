# General Dev Codebase Rules

1. **Use `pnpm` as the package manager.**  
   Always run installation and dependency commands with `pnpm` (e.g., `pnpm install` etc.).

2. **Next.js fullstack with App Router.**  
   This codebase is built on Next.js, leveraging the App Router (`app/` directory) for routing and server components.

3. **Use `shadcn` for UI components wherever possible.**  
   Prefer Shadcn’s prebuilt or customized UI elements to maintain a consistent look and feel.

4. **Loading states in UI.**  
   Ensure that every server or data-fetch action includes a visible loading state so users know an operation is in progress.

5. **Display backend responses in the UI.**  
   Expose server or API responses (success/error) in a clear way, aiding both debugging and user feedback.

6. **Use Supabase’s local dev server for development, and its PostgreSQL DB in production.**  
   For local development, spin up a local Supabase instance. In production, connect to the Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL environment. Ensure consistent schema management across both environments.

7. **Use Pinecone for vector databases.**  
   For vector-based tasks, use Pinecone. Maintain references between your main data store (Supabase) and Pinecone for efficient search and retrieval.
