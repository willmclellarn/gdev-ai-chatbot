**Episode 1 \- Why We're Doing This**

In this episode, Regan Hagestad and Warren Dow, founding partners of Titans of Mortgage, discuss the origins of the company and the problems they aim to solve within the mortgage industry. They highlight the high turnover rate and low retention rate for loan officers, emphasizing the need for better support and resources. The industry's current focus on transactions over building sustainable businesses is identified as a key challenge. Titans of Mortgage aims to provide a solution by creating a community of trusted advisors and offering accessible, high-quality resources to help loan officers thrive.

## **Key Concepts**

- **High Turnover and Attrition:** The mortgage industry faces a significant challenge with a high turnover rate of 38% annually and a 70% attrition rate for new loan officers within their first year.
- **Transactional Focus:** The industry's emphasis on transactions rather than building sustainable businesses contributes to the challenges faced by loan officers.
- **Commoditization:** The difficulty for consumers to distinguish between loan officers leads to commoditization, making it harder for individuals to stand out in the market.
- **Paradox of Choice:** The overwhelming number of choices in marketing, coaching, and technology creates paralysis and indecision for loan officers seeking to improve their businesses.
- **Accessibility and Community:** Titans of Mortgage aims to provide accessible, high-quality resources and a supportive community to help loan officers overcome these challenges and thrive.

"We're building a community of trusted advisors... a rising tide lifts all boats."

This quote emphasizes the collaborative and supportive nature of Titans of Mortgage, highlighting the belief that collective success benefits everyone within the community.

## **Action Items**

1. Take 30 minutes to reflect and evaluate your business across all areas. Look at your branding, your marketing, your process, etc. Get as granular as you can and grade yourself on a scale from 1 to 10 in each category. Then take off your mortgage hat and pretend you’re a consumer, or if you want to go the extra mile, have a friend, co-worker, spouse, friend or family member do the same exercise.

   Take a look at if there is a pattern: Did you and your friend both grade your marketing low, was marketing high but brand awareness low? Identify the area in which you need the most improvement in your business.

2. Now that you have the area where you think you have the most room to grow, go into your subscriptions and in the main courses section, filter by that area. Pick a Season to watch, use the study guide, and commit to the action items. This might take you 3 weeks or 3 months.

   Either way, we know that if you commit to following these proven systems and you implement what you learn, you will see a massive improvement in the area you need to improve the most. This is not a quick fix or an instant gratification thing, this is a foundational element to have long-term success in the mortgage industry.

## **Worth Repeating**

"We're not in the incremental better business; we're in the breakthrough transformation business."

This quote encapsulates the core philosophy of Titans of Mortgage, emphasizing the commitment to facilitating significant and lasting changes for loan officers.

## **Action Items**

1. As you are working through your first Season, from the action item in Episode 1, take some time to reflect on your mindset. Remember Titans was not built for incremental improvement or based on the principle of “if I do X then I will get Y.” That’s the hamster wheel most Originators are currently on; they get a lead, or they buy a lead and they hope that in return they close a loan. By committing to Titans, you are now in the business of breakthroughs and doing things that will pay dividends today, tomorrow and forever.

   This is a mindset of, “if I do X then I will get Y and Z and possibly even A, B and C in the future.” Ask yourself, do you currently have a belief system that is 1 to 1, or is it a system of 1 to many? Do you have beliefs that are holding you back, or do you approach the strategies you’re learning in a way that will have little to no impact? Start thinking big, meaning think about the big picture as you implement these strategies and think about big results. As you learn and implement, expect success, expect big results, and approach everything new in this way.

2. The Power of your Titans subscription comes from the community and the creators, and it is a business lifestyle change. Any lifestyle change from diets to workout plans to breaking bad habits isn’t something that can be done overnight. It’s something that requires you to reshape your mindset, something you need to do consistently every day, and you need to retrain how you approach every day.

   If you want to lose weight, eating healthy 2 days a week won’t do it, or going to the gym once a month won’t show you any results. The same goes for Titans, and studies show that having a change in habit takes 21 days in a row. This will reset your old mindset, remove the old habit, and replace it with the new, healthier habit.

   For 21 days, log in, track your data, follow your seasons, implement what you’ve learned, follow the action items, and make Titans part of your daily routine. At the end of the 21 days, be honest and ask yourself if you feel like you are running a better business, do you have a sense of achievement each day? Think about some of the old things you do, think about wins you’ve seen based on the Titans strategies. Don’t just look at production since no one becomes an $100M originator in 21 days. Look the big picture and ask yourself if you feel like you are better than you were before. Are you more focused, do you have a better plan, do you feel more confident that you will be able to reach your goals now?
